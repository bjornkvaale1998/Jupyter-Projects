    "# Fixed Income Derivatives: Problem Solutions\n",
    "This notebook contains detailed solutions to a series of problems in fixed income derivatives. Each problem is presented with a clear statement, relevant formulas, step-by-step calculations, and final answers. Where applicable, supporting calculations and results are illustrated with images from Excel sheets. The problems cover topics such as European swap options, collars, timing adjustments, and convexity adjustments.\n",
