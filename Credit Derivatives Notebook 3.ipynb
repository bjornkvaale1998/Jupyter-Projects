    "# Interest Rate Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains solutions to a set of problems related to interest rate derivatives, including the Hull–White and Vasicek models, bond and option pricing, and swap valuation. Each problem is accompanied by detailed calculations, code implementations, and results. The workflow demonstrates the application of quantitative finance techniques using Python, with supporting visualizations and references to relevant lecture materials. The notebook is organized by problem, with markdown cells providing explanations and code cells containing the computational steps."
